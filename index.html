			<h2>What is bullshit?</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="note">Bullshit is one either does not care about the truth,
				lies about his or her belief, only tells partial story, or mutates
				the fact in order to achieve the effects he or she wants.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>How many types of bullshits are there?</h2>
		<div class="floor">
			<p class="note">Bullshits can have different types from different
				angles. Notice bullshit does not necessarily have to be negative.
				It could also be positive, such as beautiful lies, which qualified for
			  bullshit due to lying about one's belief. Sometimes it can also be
				neutural especially when one uses exaggerations or common expressions
				to make one's points or express certain feelings that we may all
				understand. However, the line between negative and neutral bullshits
				often can be blurry, so we will only have "good intention" and
				"not good intention" types here.</p>

		<h2>How to measure the magnitude of a bullshit?</h2>
		<div class="floor">
			<p class="note">
				1. If a statement meets any of the four criteria above,
				it is considered as a bullshit.<br/>
			  2. Once a statement is qualified for bullshit, it can have
				one type of sources and one type of intentions, per "Bullshit
				Types Diagram" above. Intention types and source types do
				not affect the magnitude of the bushshit.<br/>

				3. According to the Venn diagram above, the more criteria a
				statement qualifies, the bigger the magnitude of the bullshit, and the
				darker the yellow region, vise versa.<br/>

				4. If a bullshit is to the public, the magnitude should add 1.<br/>
				5. If a bullshit is educational, the magnitude should add 1.</p>
